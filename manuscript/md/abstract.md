Here we show that the pupillary light response reflects exogenous (involuntary) shifts of attention and inhibition of return. Participants fixated in the center of a display that was divided into a bright and a dark half. An exogenous cue attracted attention to either the bright or dark side of the display. We found that the pupil constricted when the bright, as compared to the dark side of was cued, reflecting an exogenous shift of attention. Crucially, this pattern reversed after about one second, at which time the pupil became relatively constricted when the dark side was cued. This reflected disengagement from the previously attended location, analogous to the behavioral phenomenon of inhibition of return. Finally, there was a strong correlation between 'pupillary inhibition' and behavioral inhibition of return. We conclude that the pupillary light response is a complex eye movement that reflects how we selectively parse and interpret visual input.
