Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) is modulated by exogenous (reflexive) shifts of attention. When attention was drawn to a bright surface, the pupil initially constricted, relative to when attention was drawn to a dark surface. This shows that the PLR is not a simple reflex to retinal illumination, but is driven specifically by the brightness of attended stimuli [see also @Math么t2013Plos;@Binda2013JNeurosci;@Naber2013Osc;@Math么t2014EyePrep]. Crucially, this effect reversed after about one second, such that the pupil dilated when attention had been drawn to a bright, relative to a dark surface. This reflected inhibition of return (IOR), the inhibitory phase that typically follows exogenous shifts of attention [@Posner1984]. Individual differences showed a strong link between pupillary inhibition and IOR as measured behaviorally: Participants who showed strong pupillary inhibition also showed strong behavioral IOR, and vice versa.

The present results provide additional evidence for a close link between visual attention and the PLR, and also provide a hint as to how this link may arise. We conjecture that the PLR is modulated by activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a mid-brain area that is known for its role in attention and eye movements [@AwhArmstrongMoore2006]. Although the SC is not traditionally considered part of the PLR pathway, Wang and colleagues recently showed that microstimulation to intermediate layers of the monkey SC (SCi) triggered pupillary dilation [@WangBoehnke2012]+[; see also @Netser2010]. Although this dilation largely reflected an orienting response (i.e. not luminance-related and thus distinct from the PLR), one aspect of their results suggested involvement of the PLR as well: Dilation was more pronounced when monkeys viewed dark, as compared to bright displays. Possibly, microstimulation induced a covert shift of attention to some (unspecified) region on the display. This covert shift of attention may have triggered a pupillary constriction when this region was bright, relative to when it was dark, analogous to the present study.

A link between the PLR and SCi activity is also supported by the fact that neurons in this area exhibit the same bi-phasic pattern of facilitation and inhibition that we have demonstrated here [@FecteauMunoz2005]. Neurons in the nearby superficial layers of the SC (SCs) neither exhibit inhibition [@FecteauMunoz2005], nor trigger a pupillary dilation when stimulated [@WangBoehnke2012]. In other words, there is strong evidence for a specific link between the PLR and SCi activity, and this link may account for a wide range of findings [@Math么t2013Plos;@Binda2013JNeurosci;@Naber2013Osc;@Math么t2014EyePrep;@Naber2013Image;@Binda2013Sun;@Laeng2012Illusions].

In summary, we have shown that, after an exogenous shift of attention, the pupillary light response (PLR) exhibits the same bi-phasic pattern of facilitation followed by inhibition that is observed in behavior. This illustrates that the PLR is not a low-level reflex to luminance, but is a complex eye movement that reflects how we selectively parse and interpret visual input.
