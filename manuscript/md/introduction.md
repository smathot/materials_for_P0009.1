The pupillary light response (PLR) is a well-known physiological response that is described in most neuroanatomy textbooks. What is less well known is that the PLR, which is often assumed to be purely reflexive, is modulated by cognitive factors. For example, we and others have recently shown that the pupil constricts when you covertly (i.e. without looking at) attend to a bright stimulus, as compared to a dark stimulus [@Mathôt2013Plos;@Binda2013JNeurosci;@Naber2013Osc;@Mathôt2014EyePrep] Similarly, stimuli that are interpreted as very bright trigger a constriction, relative to equiluminant stimuli that are interpreted as less bright [e.g., pictures of the sun vs. indoor scenes; @Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Image; see also @Laeng2012Illusions]. Together, these and related findings show that the PLR is not merely a reflex response to the amount of light that falls on the retina, but is modulated by the way that we process and interpret visual input, and in particular by visual attention.

To date, studies that investigated the link between visual attention and the PLR have focused on enhancements of the PLR by endogenous (voluntary) shifts of attention [@Mathôt2013Plos;@Binda2013JNeurosci;@Naber2013Osc]. It has not been investigated whether the PLR is similarly modulated by exogenous (reflexive) shifts of attention, such as elicited by suddenly appearing stimuli. However, exogenous attention provides a particularly interesting case, because, unlike endogenous attention [@Chica2010], it is characterized by a bi-phasic response: For a brief moment after attention is exogenously captured, perception improves for the attended location. This initial facilitation is followed by a period of inhibition (of return, IOR), during which perception is impaired for the previously attended location [@Posner1984]. Plausibly, IOR serves as a 'foraging facilitator' that temporarily marks locations that have been attended and do not need to be visited again [e.g., @Klein1988].

In the present study we investigated how the PLR is modulated by exogenous shifts of attention. We used a variation of the Posner-cuing task. Participants continuously fixated the center of a display that was divided into a bright and a dark half. A brief motion stimulus was presented on the bright or dark background to capture attention. We predicted that the pupil would initially constrict when attention was drawn to the bright side, relative to the dark side, reflecting attentional facilitation. We predicted that this pattern would reverse at longer intervals after the motion stimulus, reflecting IOR.
