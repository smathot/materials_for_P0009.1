Our main analyses focus on the 2500 ms SOA (%FigPupilTrace and %FigCorrelation), because only this SOA provided a sufficiently long window for pupillary inhibition to emerge. For this reason, we also collected twice as many trials in the 2500 ms SOA as in the other SOAs. However, similar analyses can be performed for the 1000 ms SOA, and between SOAs, by cross-correlating behavior from one SOA with pupil size from another SOA.

## Pupillary cuing effect in the 1000 ms SOA

%FigAppendixPupilTrace shows the pupillary cuing effect for the 1000 ms SOA. It is a near-perfect replication of the pupillary facilitation observed for the 2500 ms SOA (compare with %FigPupilTrace). However, the interval is too short to observe pupillary inhibition.

## Pupil-size-behavior correlations

%FigAppendixCorrelation::a-d show the (cross-)correlations between the behavioral cuing effect at the 1000 and 2500 ms SOAs, and the pupillary cuing effect at these same SOAs. It is clear from the strikingly similar correlation traces that behavioral IOR correlates reliably with pupillary inhibition. Interestingly, behavior in the 1000 ms SOA is most strongly correlated with pupil size relatively early in the trial (at 973 ms; %FigAppendixCorrelation::c), whereas behavior in the 2500 ms is most strongly correlated with pupil size near the end of the trial (at 1852 ms; %FigAppendixCorrelation::a). In other words, behavior probed at a certain moment correlates most strongly with pupil size around that same moment.

%FigAppendixCorrelation::e,f show the cross-correlations between the behavioral cuing effect at the 100 ms SOA, and the pupillary cuing effect at the 1000 and 2500 ms SOAs. It is clear from the erratic correlation traces that attentional facilitation in behavior does not correlate reliably with pupillary facilitation. A possible explanation for this lack of a correlation is that the facilitatory effects of exogenous cuing are relative stable across individuals (unlike IOR, and unlike endogenous cuing, @Math√¥t2013Plos). When there are few individual differences, between-subjects correlations do not reveal anything. However, given that our sample is small, we caution against over-interpreting this null effect.

  The correlation between pupillary and behavioral cuing effects. Left column (a,c,e): pupillary data from the 2500 ms SOA; Right column (b,d,f): pupillary data from the 1000 ms SOA; Top row: behavioral data from 2500 ms; Middle row: behavioral data from 1000 ms SOA; Bottom row: behavioral data from 100 ms SOA. Pupillary data from the 100 ms SOA is not shown, because the cue-target interval was too short for any pupillary cuing effects to arise. For details, see main text and Figure 4.
